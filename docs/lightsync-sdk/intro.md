# LightSync SDK

Welcome to the Logitech LightSync SDK documentation. This SDK enables you to control RGB lighting effects and synchronization across Logitech gaming devices.

## What is LightSync?

LightSync is Logitech's RGB lighting synchronization technology that allows you to create immersive lighting experiences across multiple Logitech devices. With the LightSync SDK, you can:

- Control individual LED zones on compatible devices
- Create synchronized lighting effects across multiple devices
- Integrate lighting with game events and audio
- Build custom lighting profiles and animations

## Supported Devices

The LightSync SDK supports a wide range of Logitech gaming devices including:

- **Keyboards**: G Pro X, G915, G513, and more
- **Mice**: G Pro X Superlight, G502 HERO, G903, and more
- **Headsets**: G Pro X, G733, G935, and more
- **Mousepads**: G840, G440, and more

## Core Concepts

### LED Zones

Each device has specific LED zones that can be controlled independently. Understanding your device's LED layout is crucial for creating effective lighting effects.

### Color Management

The SDK supports various color formats and provides tools for color synchronization across devices.

### Effect Types

- **Static**: Solid colors on specific zones
- **Breathing**: Pulsing color effects
- **Wave**: Moving color patterns
- **Audio**: Lighting that responds to audio input
- **Custom**: User-defined lighting patterns

## SDK Features

- **Cross-device synchronization**: Coordinate lighting across multiple devices
- **Audio integration**: Respond to game audio and system sounds
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient lighting updates with minimal CPU usage
- **Profile management**: Save and load custom lighting configurations
- **Event-driven lighting**: Trigger effects based on game events
